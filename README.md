# Branches-And-Twigs-With-Pruning
Adds a configurable chance to get a branch when pruning a tree or twigs when pruning a bush!


Set config to something larger than 100 to always have a chance.

so if you set it to 120 skill (which is impossible) then at 100 skill you will have an 80% chance to get a branch/twig
